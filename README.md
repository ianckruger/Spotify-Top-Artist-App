# Spotify-Top-Artist-App

This repository showcases three files, a secret enviornment containing client ID keys for the api
and two main files. 

# MAIN.PY
The first file, main, contains a multitude of import files for the GUI to 
interact with and use. Main allows for the user to search the Spotify api for a certain artist, 
and return a list of their top ten songs. 

# GUI.PY
The gui file uses tkinter ( and customtkinter to make the interface look more appealing ) to interact
with the main file through a seperate interface to avoid useless terminal prints/interactions.
